# CryptoStat
This project counts several statistical metrics (mean, variance, covariance, portfolio risk and correlation with Bitcoin) for
7 cryptos (BTC, XRP, ADA, TRON, ETH,  based on given data, then represents it with table.

The first version of the program is working with linked lists, and the second version is working with arrays.
The first version is much easier to edit and add something new, while the second version works significantly faster.

To work with the program, you have to create a folder named "Data" in the folder of program, then in that folder create text files (BTC.txt, ETH.txt, ADA.txt ...) and fill this documents with data.
